[Field_Check]
type = dynamic table
sheet = Field_Check
description = Dynamic tables defined with more than @max_number_fields fields
review = Keep note that we should not have dynamic table with more than @max_number_fields fields selected. Please review the design of those dynamic tables as follow: \n   1. Uncheck the fields that are not in use. \n   2. Then if the dynamic table still have too many fields, please split the dynamic table into 2 or more.

[H_Field_Check]
type = dynamic table
sheet = H_Field_Check
description = Dynamic tables defined with more than @max_number_h_fields horizontal fields
review = Keep note that we do not recommend to have dynamic table with more than @max_number_h_fields horizontal fields. Please review the design of those dynamic tables as follow: \n   1. Remove the horizontal fields that are not in use. \n  2. Move all the horizontal fields not using parser functions into SQL requests of datamart extractions. \n

[H_DB_Field_Check]
type = dynamic table
sheet = H_DB_Field_Check
description = Dynamic tables defined with more than @max_number_db_access_h_fields direct access to DB in horizontal fields
review = For performance reason, we do not recommend to have dynamic table with horizontal fields accessing the DB directly. Please review the design of those dynamic tables as follow: \n   1. Remove all horizontal fields that are using the parser functions *TBLFIELD and *TABLE. \n   2. Then create SQL based datamart tables to retrieve such fields from financial database(DBF) and join them in SQL request of datamart extractions.

[Sensi_Flag_Check]
type = dynamic table
sheet = Sensi_Flag_Check
description = Dynamic tables with sensitivity flag enabled BUT not using S_* fields
review = We do not recommend to have sensitivity flag checked when S_* fields are not selected in the dynamic table. However, parser functions RT_* require the flag to be checked. If such parser functions are used in horizontal fields, do check the flag.

[Build_Mode_Check]
type = dynamic table
sheet = Build_Mode_Check
description = Dynamic tables for which "Built on" is not selected in underlying Sim view "Context(s)"
review = Dynamic tables' "build on" shall be consistent with its underlying Simulation view "Context(s)". For example, if underlying simulation viewer's context is "consolidate", then the dynamic table's "build on" shall be set to "consolidate" as well.

The fields can be retrieved by table join in SQL request of datamart extraction.

[Field_Reference_Detail]
type = dynamic table
sheet = Field_Reference_Detail
description = Details of dynamic table fields that are referenced more than @max_dynamic_table_referenced time(s)
review = Recommendation is to minimize the duplication of fields that are not key across datamart tables. Please review the design of those dynamic tables to uncheck fields that are already available in another datamart table if possible. The fields can be retrieved by table join in SQL request of datamart extraction.

[Fields_Check]
type = datamart table
sheet = Fields_Check
description = Datamart tables defined with more than @max_number_fields field(s)
review = Keep note that we should not have datamart table with more than @max_number_fields fields. Please review the design of the underlying dynamic tables as follow: \n   1. Uncheck the fields that are not in use. \n   2. Then if the dynamic table still have too many fields, please split the dynamic table into 2 or more.

[#_Fields_REP_Vs_Dyn]
type = datamart table
sheet = #_Fields_REP_Vs_Dyn
description = Datamart table(s) defined with less fields than underlying dynamic table(s)
review = For performance reason, datamart table shall not have less fields than underlying dynamic table because unused fields are calculated as well and this takes resources(CPU, IO time). Please review the design of underlying dynamic tables assuring that only used fields in datamart tables are selected.

[No_Indexed_Tables]
type = datamart table
sheet = No_Indexed_Tables
description = Datamart tables without index
review = Following tables do not have index defined via Mx GUI. Defintion of index might be to consider. Indecies for datamart tables shall be defined throught datamart GUI.

[Summary_REP_TAB]
type = feeder
sheet = Summary_REP_TAB
description = Summary of datamart tables referenced by more than @max_reference table feeders
review = Recommendation is to have only 1 datamart table in 1 table feeder. Please use the next sheet to review the design of following tables to understand if it is necessary to include them in more than @max_reference feeders.

[REP_TAB_VS_T_FEED]
type = feeder
sheet = REP_TAB_VS_T_FEED
description = Details of datamart tables referenced by more than @max_reference table feeders

type = feeder
sheet = Summary_T_FEED_1
description = Summary of table feeders that are feeding more than @max_reference datamart table(s)

[T_FEED_VS_DM]
type = feeder
sheet = T_FEED_VS_DM
description = Details of table feeders that are feeding more than @max_reference datamart table(s)

description = Number of table feeders for each batch of feeders
review = Recommendation is to have only 1 feeder in 1 batch of feeders.

[Filter_conflict]
type = feeder
sheet = Filter_conflict
description = Chain of filters from Dynamic table to Batch of feeders
review = Recommendation is not to have default settings in dynamic tables. However as post filter is only available in default settings, it is sometimes ok to have post filter set in default settings. Please review the following default settings and move them to global settings if possible.
